# IPTables [DO NOT USE Ubuntu Version  unless you want a broken firewall]

## What is this?
A simple script to protect your Linux Machine from hackers!

## Installation

Ubuntu based systems:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ItzBunniYT/GoodIPTables.git
$ cd GoodIPTables
$ chmod a+x GoodIPTables-Ubuntu.sh
$ ./GoodIPTables-Ubuntu.sh
```
Other Linux Based Operating Systems:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ItzBunniYT/GoodIPTables.git
$ cd GoodIPTables
$ chmod a+x GoodIPTables.sh
$ ./GoodIPTables.sh
```

### I have a problem, what should I do?

We don't maintain this repository, but the commands are practically the same.
In case of an IPTables update that completely breaks / makes the commands malfunction, we are not planning on making a major update on it.

### I wanna fork this to my own operating system or to another firewall.

You can do it if you want to. You can also make a pull request (if it looks promising) and we might consider merging it!
